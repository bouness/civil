What is the transfer length in a pretensioned member, why is it important for detailing, and how is it typically accommodated in design drawings/placement of reinforcement?

:::tip[Solution]
**Transfer length** is the length from the end of a pretensioned member over which the prestressing force is transferred from the tendon to the concrete by bond. It is important because within the transfer length the tendon force is not fully effective in producing compressive stress in the concrete, and special detailing (e.g., extra concrete cover, no cutouts, proper reinforcement) and anchorage zones are required to avoid splitting and ensure adequate confinement. In drawings, designers usually show transfer length zones near member ends where additional transverse reinforcement (confinement, stirrups), closer stirrup spacing, and sometimes larger end zones or bearing plates are provided. Transfer length also controls location of splices, openings, and anchored details.
