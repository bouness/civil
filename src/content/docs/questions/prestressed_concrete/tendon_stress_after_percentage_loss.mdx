A prestressing tendon was tensioned to an initial stress $f_{pi} = 180~\text{ksi}$ (steel), and total losses (elastic, creep, shrinkage, relaxation, friction where applicable) are estimated as $8\%$ of the initial stress. Compute the tendon stress after losses $f_{p,\text{service}}$ (ksi) and the corresponding force in a single tendon having steel area $A_p = 0.30~\text{in}^2$ (kips).

Loss amount (ksi):

$$
\Delta f = 0.08 \times 180 = 14.4~\text{ksi}.
$$

Tendon stress after losses:

$$
f_{p,service} = 180 - 14.4 = 165.6~\text{ksi}.
$$

Force in tendon:

$$
P = f_{p,service} A_p = 165.6(0.30) = 49.68~\text{ksi·in}^2 = 49.68~\text{kips}.
$$

(1 ksi·in^2 = 1 kip)

**Answer:** $f_{p,service}=165.6\ \text{ksi}$; $P\approx49.68\ \text{kips}$.
