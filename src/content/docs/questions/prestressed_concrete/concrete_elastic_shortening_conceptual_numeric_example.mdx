Given a prestressing force $P=100~\text{kips}$ acting on a member with gross area $A_g=400~\text{in}^2$, compute the average compressive stress and the approximate elastic strain in the concrete if $E_c=3.6\times10^6~\text{psi}$. Then explain qualitatively how that strain affects tendon stress (elastic shortening).

Average compressive stress:

$$
\sigma_c=\frac{P}{A_g} = \frac{100{,}000}{400} = 250~\text{psi} = 0.250~\text{ksi}.
$$

Concrete elastic strain:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\sigma_c}{E_c} = \frac{250}{3.6\times10^6} = 6.94\times10^{-5}.
$$

This strain shortens the concrete immediately; bonded tendons experience a corresponding decrease in tensile strain (and thus stress) equal to the concrete strain (modified by relative elastic moduli and tendon bonding), producing an immediate loss of prestress called **elastic shortening**. Elastic shortening is typically one of the first (immediate) losses accounted for in prestressed design.
