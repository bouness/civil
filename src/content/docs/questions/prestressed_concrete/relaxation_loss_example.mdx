:::note[Difficulty: **Easy** - Category: **Prestressed Concrete**]
If the initial tendon stress is $f_{pi} = 190~\text{ksi}$ and relaxation is estimated at 3% of the initial stress, compute the tendon stress after relaxation alone.

:::tip[Solution]
Relaxation loss:

$$
\Delta f = 0.03(190) = 5.7~\text{ksi}.
$$

Post-relaxation stress:

$$
f_{p,after} = 190 - 5.7 = 184.30~\text{ksi}.
$$

**Answer:** $184.30~\text{ksi}$ after relaxation.
