List two ways prestressing (induced axial compression) affects the shear capacity of a concrete member and explain why designers sometimes take credit for axial compression when checking shear.

:::tip[Solution]
Two effects of prestress (axial compression) on shear capacity:

1. **Vertical compressive stress increases aggregate interlock** and aggregate-flesh bearing across potential shear cracks; compressive stress tends to close cracks and improve shear transfer across cracked sections, increasing concrete shear capacity.  
2. **Reduction in net tensile strains**: axial compression reduces tensile strains under service loads, delaying crack formation and keeping member in a state where concrete shear mechanisms remain effective.

Designers sometimes take credit for axial compression in shear checks because ACI and other codes permit influence of axial force on shear capacity (through terms that increase concrete shear strength with compressive stress), provided the compression is reliably present at the service load level and the effect is not otherwise double-counted with other resistance factors.
