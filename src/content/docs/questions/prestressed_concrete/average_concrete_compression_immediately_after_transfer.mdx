:::note[Difficulty: **Easy** - Category: **Prestressed Concrete**]
A pretensioned beam receives an initial tendon force $P_i = 400~\text{kips}$ (i.e., 400,000 lb). The gross concrete area is $A_g = 300~\text{in}^2$. Compute the average compressive stress in the concrete immediately after transfer (ignore eccentricity and losses). Give the answer in psi and ksi.

:::tip[Solution]
Average compressive stress:

$$
\sigma_c = \frac{P_i}{A_g} = \frac{400{,}000\ \text{lb}}{300\ \text{in}^2} = 1333.33\ \text{psi} = 1.333\ \text{ksi}.
$$
