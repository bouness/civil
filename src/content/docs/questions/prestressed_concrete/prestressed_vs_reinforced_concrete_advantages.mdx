Three common advantages:

1. **Control or elimination of tensile cracking under service loads** — prestress introduces compression that offsets tensile stresses, improving durability and serviceability.  
2. **Longer spans and reduced cross-section** — prestressing provides higher flexural capacity per unit area, allowing slimmer beams/girders and longer spans with less material.  
3. **Improved fatigue and deflection behavior** — prestressed members generally have smaller service deflections and better performance under repeated loads because cracking is delayed or prevented and the section remains essentially uncracked.

Other advantages: better crack widths (narrower), improved durability, and potential construction efficiencies (precast prestressed elements).
