A prestressing force produces an average axial compression in a member of $P=60~\text{kips}$ with gross section area $A_g = 300~\text{in}^2$. Compute the average compressive stress (psi and ksi). Briefly state how this compressive stress influences shear capacity of the concrete member.

:::tip[Solution]
Average compressive stress:

$$
\sigma = \frac{P}{A_g} = \frac{60{,}000}{300} = 200~\text{psi} = 0.200~\text{ksi}.
$$

Effect on shear capacity: axial compression helps to close or reduce crack widths and increases aggregate interlock and bearing across potential shear cracks; codes and design models often permit a modest increase in concrete shear strength when reliable compressive stress is present. However, the effect is usually modest and must be demonstrated or limited by code provisions.
