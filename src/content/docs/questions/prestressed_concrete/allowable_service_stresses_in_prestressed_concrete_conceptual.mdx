:::tip[Solution]
Two common service-level stress limits:

1. **Concrete compressive stress limit (e.g., maximum allowable compressive stress at service)** — to avoid exceeding tensile capacity under reversed loading, to control long-term creep/shrinkage effects, and to reduce risk of cracking or crushing during construction and service. Codes give allowable limits often as a fraction of $\sqrt{f'_c}$ or of $f'_c$ depending on context.  
2. **Tendon (steel) allowable stress at service (or allowable relaxation limits)** — designers limit tendon stress after losses to ensure adequate margin to yield, to control long-term relaxation losses, and to avoid overstressing the steel during short-term events (e.g., jacking). This is often expressed as a percentage of guaranteed ultimate or yield (e.g., keep post-loss stress below some value), and also to limit immediate strain to control cracking and durability.

Rationale: these limits protect durability, control deflections/cracking, and keep member behavior predictable during long-term loading.
