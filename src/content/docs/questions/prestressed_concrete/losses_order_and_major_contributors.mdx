:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Prestressed Concrete**]
List the common types of prestress losses (immediate and long-term) in the order they are typically encountered and name the two largest contributors for pre-tensioned members.

<TabItem label='Solution'>
:::tip[Solution]
Common losses in typical chronological order:
1. **Elastic shortening of concrete (immediate).**
2. **Friction and anchorage set (for post-tensioning; not for pre-tensioning).**
3. **Relaxation of prestressing steel (starts immediately; may occur over time).**
4. **Creep of concrete (long-term).**
5. **Shrinkage of concrete (long-term).**

For **pre-tensioned members**, the two largest contributors are usually **elastic shortening** (immediate) and **creep of concrete** (long-term). Relaxation can also be significant depending on tendon type and initial stress.
