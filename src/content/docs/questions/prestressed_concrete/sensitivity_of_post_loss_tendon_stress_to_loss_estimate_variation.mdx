With an initial tendon stress $f_{pi} = 200~\text{ksi}$, compare post-loss stresses if total losses are estimated at 10% (base), 8% (optimistic), and 12% (pessimistic). Report post-loss stresses (ksi) and comment on sensitivity.

:::tip[Solution]
Post-loss stresses:
- Loss 10% → $f_{ps}=200(1-0.10)=180.00~\text{ksi}$.  
- Loss 8% → $f_{ps}=200(1-0.08)=184.00~\text{ksi}$.  
- Loss 12% → $f_{ps}=200(1-0.12)=176.00~\text{ksi}$.  

**Comment:** Changing the loss estimate by ±2% changes the post-loss stress by ±4 ksi (≈±2.2%). Designers should quantify and reduce uncertainty in loss estimates for tight serviceability or strength margins.
