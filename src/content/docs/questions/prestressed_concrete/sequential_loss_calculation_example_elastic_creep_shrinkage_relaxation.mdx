Perform a sequential loss calculation for an initial tendon stress $f_{pi} = 210~\text{ksi}$ with the following sequential percentage losses applied multiplicatively: elastic shortening 4%, creep 5%, shrinkage 1.5%, relaxation 2%. Show the remaining tendon stress after each step.

:::tip[Solution]
Start $f_{pi}=210.00~\text{ksi}$.
Sequential application (loss = percentage × current stress):

- 4.00% loss → lost = 8.40 ksi, remaining = 201.60 ksi.  
- 5.00% loss → lost = 10.08 ksi, remaining = 191.52 ksi.  
- 1.50% loss → lost = 2.87 ksi, remaining = 188.65 ksi.  
- 2.00% loss → lost = 3.77 ksi, remaining = **184.88 ksi**.

**Answer (summary):** remaining stresses after each step ≈ 201.60, 191.52, 188.65, and **184.88 ksi**.
