A prestressed beam gross area is $A_g=200~\text{in}^2$. Service-level design limits require that compressive stress from prestress alone not exceed $f_{c,allow}=3.0~\text{ksi}$. If total prestress losses are expected to be $10\%$ of initial tendon stress and tendons total area results in equivalent initial force $P_i = A_{ps} f_{pi}$ (assume single equivalent tendon area so that you can work in stress terms), determine the **maximum initial tendon stress $f_{pi,max}$** such that the post-loss average concrete compressive stress does not exceed $3.0~\text{ksi}$. (Ignore eccentricity.)

:::tip[Solution]
Let $f_{pi}$ be initial tendon stress. After 10% losses, tendon stress = $0.90 f_{pi}$. Average concrete compressive stress after losses:

$$
\sigma_c = \frac{P_{service}}{A_g} = \frac{A_{ps}(0.90 f_{pi})}{A_g}.
$$

Assume equivalent tendon area $A_{ps}$ cancels if we express requirement per unit tendon area. Solve for $f_{pi}$ to make $\sigma_c \le 3.0~\text{ksi}$.
Rearrange for general case with single-equivalent tendon area:

$$
0.90 f_{pi} \frac{A_{ps}}{A_g} \le 3.0~\text{ksi}.
$$

If we take $A_{ps}$ as unknown, solve for $f_{pi}$ per unit $A_{ps}$:

$$
f_{pi} \le \frac{3.0 A_g}{0.90 A_{ps}}.
$$

To give a numeric result, assume the equivalent tendon area is $A_{ps}=0.9~\text{in}^2$ (example for calculation):

$$
f_{pi} \le \frac{3.0(200)}{0.90(0.9)} = \frac{600}{0.81} = 740.74~\text{ksi}
$$

This unrealistic large number indicates that with the stated areas the limiting factor is unlikely to be compressive stress — in practice you would pick $A_{ps}$ (sum of tendon areas) first. The correct approach: pick tendon area then compute allowable initial stress.  

**Interpretation:** The inequality above gives the general relation. Insert actual $A_{ps}$ to get numeric $f_{pi,max}$. (Example used $A_{ps}=0.9~\text{in}^2$ only for demonstration.)
