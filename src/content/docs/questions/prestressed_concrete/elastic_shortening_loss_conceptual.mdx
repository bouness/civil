Explain briefly what elastic shortening loss is in prestressed concrete, when it occurs, and whether it primarily affects pre-tensioned or post-tensioned members.

**Answer (short):** Elastic shortening is the loss of prestress in the tendon (or a reduction in tendon strain) that occurs immediately at transfer (or after release) because the concrete layer carrying the prestress shortens elastically under the prestressing force. It causes an immediate reduction of stress in adjacent tendons or an effective reduction of the tendon-contributed force seen by the concrete. Elastic shortening affects both pre-tensioned and post-tensioned members, but it is most significant for pre-tensioned members (transfer at deck/fabrication) and for concrete elements where large volumes of concrete shorten under relatively small strain (e.g., members with high steel ratio). It also produces an immediate compressive strain in the concrete and may be followed by additional long-term creep-related losses.
