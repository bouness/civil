A post-tensioning tendon passes through 3 significant curvature regions and you estimate a 2% loss in each region. Estimate the cumulative percent loss due to those curvature-related friction losses (approximate multiplicative effect).

:::tip[Solution]
Assuming multiplicative retention per bend: retained fraction after 3 bends = $(1-0.02)^3$.
Cumulative loss = $1-(1-0.02)^3 = 1 - 0.98^3 = 1 - 0.94118 = 0.05882 = 5.882\%.$
**Answer:** ≈ **5.88%** cumulative loss from the three bends (approx).
