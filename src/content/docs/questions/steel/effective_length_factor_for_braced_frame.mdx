:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Steel**]
A steel column is part of a **braced frame** with pinned ends in both directions. Determine the appropriate effective length factor $K$ for buckling about the weak axis.

:::tip[Solution]
**Concept and Solution:**
For a **braced frame**, the lateral translation is prevented at both ends.
When both ends are pinned (no rotational restraint):

$$
K = 1.0
$$

This value corresponds to the classical pinned–pinned column buckling condition.
Thus, **$K = 1.0$ for buckling about the weak axis.**
