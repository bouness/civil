:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Steel**]
A steel beam supports a concrete slab. Using a simplified rule, the effective flange width for composite design on each side of the beam centerline may be taken as the smaller of: 1) one-quarter of the span, or 2) half the distance to the adjacent beam. If span = 24 ft and center-to-center distance to adjacent beam = 10 ft, what is the effective flange width per side in ft?

:::tip[Solution]
Compute option 1: one-quarter span = $\tfrac{1}{4}(24) = 6~\text{ft}$.
Compute option 2: half the distance to adjacent beam = $\tfrac{1}{2}(10) = 5~\text{ft}$.
The smaller of the two is **5 ft per side**. Thus the effective flange width per side = **5 ft** (total effective flange width = 10 ft).
