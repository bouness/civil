A bolted connection uses 7/8-in diameter bolts with 1-in diameter holes. The minimum edge distance provided is 1.5 in from the center of the hole to the edge of the plate. Per AISC, the minimum edge distance for a 7/8-in bolt is 1-1/8 in. Does the provided edge distance satisfy the minimum requirement?

**Bolt Edge Distance Check**

**Step 1: Understanding 'satisfy'**
'Satisfy' means to **meet** or **fulfill** a requirement.

This seems straightforward, but the trap is in the comparison.

**Step 2: Given information**
Provided edge distance: $L_e = 1.5~\text{in}$

Minimum required edge distance: $L_{e,min} = 1.125~\text{in}$ (or $1\frac{1}{8}~\text{in}$)

**Step 3: Compare values**
$1.5~\text{in} > 1.125~\text{in}$

Provided distance **EXCEEDS** minimum requirement.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
Does 1.5 in satisfy the minimum of 1.125 in?

**YES** - The provided edge distance DOES satisfy (meet) the requirement.

$1.5 > 1.125$ ✓ (Adequate)

**Common trap:** The simple language and clear numbers might make test-takers second-guess themselves or look for a hidden complexity. Sometimes NCEES includes straightforward questions among tricky ones to test if candidates overthink.

**Step 5: Additional check - Maximum edge distance**
Per AISC, maximum edge distance = $12t$ or $6~\text{in}$ (for painted steel)

This would need plate thickness to verify, but the question only asks about minimum.

**Answer: YES, the provided edge distance (1.5 in) satisfies the minimum requirement (1.125 in).**

**Key lesson:** Not every question is tricky, but knowing vocabulary like 'satisfy,' 'exceed,' 'preclude,' and 'obviate' prevents errors on questions that ARE tricky.
