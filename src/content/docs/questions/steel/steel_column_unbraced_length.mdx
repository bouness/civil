A W10×49 column has an unbraced length of 18 ft about the weak axis. Intermediate bracing is provided at 9 ft from the base. The column base and top are pinned. Does the presence of intermediate bracing mitigate the effective length for weak-axis buckling to less than 18 ft?

**Column Effective Length Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'mitigate'**
'Mitigate' means to **reduce** or **make less severe**.

The question asks: Does bracing **reduce** the effective length to less than 18 ft?

**Step 2: Analyze bracing condition**
Column configuration:
- Total height: 18 ft
- Base: pinned
- Top: pinned
- Intermediate brace at: 9 ft from base

**Step 3: Effective length factor**
For pinned-pinned column: $K = 1.0$

With intermediate bracing at midpoint:
- Column is divided into two segments
- Each segment: $L = 9~\text{ft}$
- Effective length per segment: $KL = 1.0(9) = 9~\text{ft}$

**Step 4: Compare to original length**
Without intermediate brace: $KL = 1.0(18) = 18~\text{ft}$

With intermediate brace: $KL = 1.0(9) = 9~\text{ft}$

$9~\text{ft} < 18~\text{ft}$

**Step 5: Answer the question**
Does bracing mitigate (reduce) the effective length to **less than** 18 ft?

**YES** - The intermediate bracing DOES mitigate the effective length.

The effective length is reduced from 18 ft to 9 ft, which is indeed less than 18 ft.

**Common trap:** Candidates might focus on whether the effective length equals exactly half (9 ft) rather than answering whether it's 'less than 18 ft.' The question uses specific wording.

**Step 6: Design impact**
$\frac{KL}{r_y}$ is reduced by half, significantly increasing column capacity:

$P_n = F_{cr} A_g$ where $F_{cr}$ depends on $\frac{KL}{r}$

Smaller slenderness ratio → higher critical stress

**Answer: YES, intermediate bracing mitigates (reduces) the effective length to 9 ft, which is less than 18 ft.**
