A floor beam has a calculated live load deflection of $\Delta_L = 0.85~\text{in}$ under full live load. The span is 30 ft and the deflection limit is $L/360$. Does the calculated deflection contravene the serviceability requirement?

**Deflection Serviceability Check**

**Step 1: Understanding 'contravene'**
'Contravene' means to **violate**, **conflict with**, or **go against** a requirement.

This is formal/legal vocabulary meaning to break a rule.

**Step 2: Calculate allowable deflection**
$\Delta_{allow} = \frac{L}{360} = \frac{30 \times 12}{360} = \frac{360}{360} = 1.0~\text{in}$

**Step 3: Compare actual to allowable**
Actual deflection: $\Delta_L = 0.85~\text{in}$

Allowable deflection: $\Delta_{allow} = 1.0~\text{in}$

$0.85~\text{in} < 1.0~\text{in}$

**Step 4: Interpretation**
Does 0.85 in contravene (violate) the limit of 1.0 in?

**NO** - The deflection does NOT contravene the serviceability requirement.

The actual deflection is less than the allowable limit, so it complies with (rather than violates) the requirement.

**Common trap:** 'Contravene' sounds technical and might cause hesitation. Some might think it means 'concern' or 'relate to' rather than 'violate.'

**Step 5: Safety margin**
Safety margin: $1.0 - 0.85 = 0.15~\text{in}$

Percentage of limit used: $\frac{0.85}{1.0} = 85\%$

The beam has 15% deflection capacity remaining.

**Step 6: Design status**
The beam **PASSES** the serviceability check for deflection.

$\Delta_L = 0.85~\text{in} < \Delta_{allow} = 1.0~\text{in}$ ✓

**Answer: NO, the deflection (0.85 in) does NOT contravene (violate) the serviceability requirement (1.0 in). The beam is acceptable.**
