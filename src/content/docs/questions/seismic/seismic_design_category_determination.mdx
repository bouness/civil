:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Seismic**]
An office building (Risk Category II) is located in a region with $S_{DS} = 0.45$ and $S_{D1} = 0.25$. The building is 40 ft tall. What is the Seismic Design Category (SDC) for this structure per ASCE 7-16?

**Seismic Design Category Determination**

Using ASCE 7-16 Table 11.6-1 and 11.6-2:

**Based on $S_{DS} = 0.45$:**
- Risk Category II: $S_{DS} = 0.45$ falls between 0.33 and 0.50
- Therefore, SDC = **C** (from Table 11.6-1)

**Based on $S_{D1} = 0.25$:**
- Risk Category II: $S_{D1} = 0.25$ falls between 0.133 and 0.20
- Therefore, SDC = **C** (from Table 11.6-2)

**The more restrictive SDC governs.** Both values give SDC = C.

**Final Seismic Design Category: SDC C**

Note: The building height (40 ft) does not affect the basic SDC determination but may impact other seismic design requirements.
