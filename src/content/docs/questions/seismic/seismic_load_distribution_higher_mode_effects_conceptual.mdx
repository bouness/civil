Explain briefly why higher-mode effects might be important for tall, irregular, or torsionally sensitive structures when distributing seismic base shear to story forces.

:::tip[Solution]
Higher-mode effects are important because the first-mode (fundamental) modal shape may not capture concentrations of inertia forces in taller or irregular structures. Higher modes can produce significant additional story shears and floor accelerations (particularly in upper stories), influence torsional response, and alter load distribution — leading to underestimated internal forces and demands if only the first mode is used. Therefore modal response-spectrum analysis (including several modes) is required for tall, irregular, or torsionally sensitive buildings.
