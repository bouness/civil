If a client asks you to approve a modification that you believe reduces safety but saves cost and the client insists, what are two appropriate actions the licensed engineer should take according to typical professional practice/ethics guidance?

Two appropriate actions:

1. **Explain clearly in writing** the safety, performance, and code implications of the proposed modification and provide alternatives that meet safety and code requirements.  
2. **Refuse to approve or stamp** designs that do not comply with applicable codes or that you reasonably believe are unsafe; if necessary, escalate to appropriate authorities or obtain a written acknowledgment that the client chose a non-compliant approach (while still refusing to take professional responsibility for unsafe design).  
(Always follow jurisdictional licensing board rules and employer policies.)
