:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
In computing one-way shear strength $V_c$, an engineer mistakenly uses the **overall beam height** $h$ instead of the **effective depth** $d$. Which of the following statements correctly describes the impact?

A) Using $h$ instead of $d$ is conservative and precludes unsafe design.

B) Using $h$ instead of $d$ artificially increases $V_c$, potentially leading to unconservative results.

C) The difference between $h$ and $d$ is negligible for all practical beams.

D) The use of $h$ instead of $d$ is explicitly permitted when shear reinforcement is provided.

**Correct Answer: B**

ACI 318 defines shear strength of concrete as:

$$
V_c = 2 \lambda \sqrt{f'_c} b d
$$

If $h > d$, substituting $h$ overestimates $V_c$ and reduces required shear steel — this is **unconservative**.

- **Trap:** Option A misleads by implying a conservative bias; the term *precludes unsafe design* is false — it does the opposite.
