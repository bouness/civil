A #6 deformed bar ($d_b = 0.75~\text{in}$) is placed in normal-weight concrete $f'_c = 5000~\text{psi}$, with $f_y = 60,000~\text{psi}$. The bar is not epoxy-coated, not a top bar, and is well confined. Compute the required development length $l_d$.

:::tip[Solution]
**Step 1.** ACI 318 formula for tension development length:

$$
l_d = \frac{3}{40} \cdot \frac{f_y d_b}{\sqrt{f'_c}}
$$


$$
l_d = \frac{3}{40} \cdot \frac{60,000(0.75)}{\sqrt{5000}} = 0.075 \cdot \frac{45,000}{70.7} = 47.7~\text{in}
$$


**Answer:** $l_d = 47.7~\text{inches}$
