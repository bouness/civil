:::danger[Difficulty: **Hard** - Category: **Concrete**]
A continuous beam has #8 bottom bars that must be developed at a point of maximum positive moment. The required development length is $\ell_d = 48~\text{in}$. The point of maximum moment is located 8 ft from the face of support, and bars extend 3 ft beyond this point before termination. Does the available length obviate the need for hooks at the bar termination?

**Development Length Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'obviate'**
The word 'obviate' means to **remove the need for** or **make unnecessary**. This is sophisticated vocabulary that can be confusing under exam pressure.

**Step 2: Calculate available development length**
Bars must develop at point of maximum moment.

Distance available beyond max moment point: $3~\text{ft} = 36~\text{in}$

Required development length: $\ell_d = 48~\text{in}$

**Step 3: Compare available vs. required**
$36~\text{in} < 48~\text{in}$

Available length is **INSUFFICIENT**.

**Step 4: Interpretation**
Does the available length (36 in) obviate (eliminate the need for) hooks?

**NO** - The available length does NOT obviate the need for hooks.

Since only 36 inches are available but 48 inches are required, the bars are **NOT** fully developed. Therefore, hooks or other measures **ARE REQUIRED**.

**Common error:** Thinking 'obviate' means 'require' or 'create a need for' when it means the opposite.

**Step 5: Additional consideration**
Per ACI 318, bars terminated in a tension zone require either:
- Full development length, OR  
- Standard hooks, OR
- Mechanical anchorage

Since full development cannot be achieved, hooks are needed.

**Answer: NO, the available length does NOT obviate (eliminate) the need for hooks. Hooks ARE REQUIRED.**
