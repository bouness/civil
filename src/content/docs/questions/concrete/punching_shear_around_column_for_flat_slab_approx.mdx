A flat slab supports a column of size 18 in × 18 in and at the critical perimeter (d/2) the effective perimeter is computed as $b_0$. For a square column, $b_0 \approx 4(c + d)$ where $c$ = column side and $d$ is effective depth. If $c=18~\text{in}$ and $d=8~\text{in}$ compute $b_0$ in inches and in feet. (This is a simplified approximate expression — use it directly.)

Compute $b_0 = 4(c + d) = 4(18 + 8) = 4(26) = 104~\text{in}$.
Convert to feet: $104~\text{in} = 104/12 = 8.6666667~\text{ft} = 8\tfrac{2}{3}~\text{ft}$.
Thus **$b_0 = 104~\text{in} \approx 8.67~\text{ft}$.**
