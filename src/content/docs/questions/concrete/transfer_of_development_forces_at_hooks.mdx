:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
A #5 hooked bar is used in a slab edge beam. The designer argues that using a 180° hook **precludes** any need to check side cover or spacing. Is this correct per ACI 318?

A) Yes, because a 180° hook provides complete anchorage regardless of confinement.

B) No, the hook development length is affected by cover and spacing.

C) Yes, provided $f'_c \ge 4000~\text{psi}$.

D) Only for bars in compression.

**Correct Answer: B**

Per ACI 318-14 Section 25.4.3, hooked bar development length $l_{dh}$ must be increased by 20% if clear cover $< 2.5~d_b$ or bar spacing $< 3~d_b$. Thus, cover and spacing **directly influence** the required development length.

- **Trap:** The use of *precludes* may trick readers into believing the hook’s bend geometry overrides all confinement effects — it does not.
