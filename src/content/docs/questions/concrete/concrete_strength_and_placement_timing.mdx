A concrete slab is required to achieve a compressive strength of 3000 psi before formwork removal. Cylinders tested at 7 days show an average strength of 2400 psi. The specified 28-day strength is $f'_c = 4000~\text{psi}$. Does this preclude removing the formwork at 7 days?

**Analysis of Formwork Removal Requirements**

**Step 1: Understanding 'preclude'**
The word 'preclude' means to **prevent** or **make impossible**. It does NOT mean to allow or include.

**Step 2: Analyze the given data**
- Required strength before removal: 3000 psi
- Actual strength at 7 days: 2400 psi
- Specified 28-day strength: 4000 psi

**Step 3: Compare values**
$2400~\text{psi} < 3000~\text{psi}$

The concrete has NOT achieved the required strength of 3000 psi.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
**YES**, this **precludes** (prevents/prohibits) removing the formwork at 7 days.

The formwork CANNOT be removed because the concrete strength is insufficient. The word 'preclude' means the low strength **prevents** the action from occurring.

**Note:** The 28-day design strength of 4000 psi is irrelevant to this question. What matters is whether the actual 7-day strength meets the minimum required strength for formwork removal.

**Answer: Yes, formwork removal is precluded (prohibited) at 7 days.**
