An engineer claims a section with a steel strain $\varepsilon_t = 0.002$ is *not tension-controlled* and therefore may be classified as *transition-controlled*. Does ACI 318 **preclude** the use of $\phi = 0.9$ for this case?

A) Yes, ACI 318 precludes it because $\varepsilon_t < 0.005$.

B) No, ACI 318 allows $\phi = 0.9$ when $\varepsilon_t > 0.002$.

C) No, $\phi$ can be linearly interpolated between 0.65 and 0.9.

D) Yes, but only for tied columns.

**Correct Answer: C**

Per ACI 318-14 Section 21.2.2, when $\varepsilon_t$ is between 0.002 and 0.005, the section is **transition-controlled**, and $\phi$ is **interpolated linearly** between 0.65 and 0.9. Only when $\varepsilon_t \ge 0.005$ is it fully tension-controlled.

- **Trap:** The question’s wording *preclude the use of $\phi=0.9$* might push test-takers to answer A, but interpolation is permitted — thus $\phi=0.9$ is only **partially precluded**.
