A simply supported beam 12 inches wide and 24 inches deep is subjected to a factored shear of $V_u = 75~\text{kips}$ at the support. The beam is made of concrete with $f'_c = 4000~\text{psi}$ and has no shear reinforcement. Determine if the beam satisfies ACI 318 one-way shear requirements.

**Step 1.** Compute nominal shear strength provided by concrete:

$$
V_c = 2 \sqrt{f'_c} b d / 1000
$$


$$
V_c = 2(\sqrt{4000})(12)(24)/1000 = 2(63.25)(288)/1000 = 36.4~\text{kips}
$$


**Step 2.** Design strength:

$$
\phi V_c = 0.75(36.4) = 27.3~\text{kips}
$$


**Step 3.** Compare with applied shear:

$$
V_u = 75~\text{kips} > \phi V_c = 27.3~\text{kips}
$$


**Conclusion:** The beam **does not satisfy** one-way shear without shear reinforcement. Stirrups are required.
