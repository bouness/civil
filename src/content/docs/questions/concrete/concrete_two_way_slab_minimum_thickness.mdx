A two-way flat plate slab with panels 24 ft x 28 ft is supported by interior columns. The slab has Grade 60 reinforcement and no edge beams. Determine the minimum slab thickness required by ACI 318 for deflection control.

**Two-Way Slab Minimum Thickness**

**Step 1: Identify slab type and parameters**
This is a flat plate slab (no beams between supports).
$f_y = 60,000~\text{psi}$
Longer clear span $\ell_n = 28~\text{ft} = 336~\text{in}$

**Step 2: Apply ACI Table 8.3.1.1**
For flat plates without edge beams:
Minimum $h = \frac{\ell_n}{30}$ for $f_y = 60,000~\text{psi}$

**Step 3: Calculate minimum thickness**
$h_{min} = \frac{336}{30} = 11.2~\text{in}$

**Step 4: Check absolute minimum**
ACI 8.3.1.1 requires $h \geq 5~\text{in}$ for slabs without drops.
$11.2~\text{in} > 5~\text{in}$ ✓

**Step 5: Final selection**
Use $h = 11.5~\text{in}$ (round up to nearest 0.5 in for practicality)

**Minimum slab thickness: 11.5 inches**
