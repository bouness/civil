Purpose: Temperature and shrinkage reinforcement controls cracking from restrained shrinkage and temperature changes by distributing cracks into closely spaced fine cracks and limiting crack width. It provides continuity and resistance to shrinkage strains.

ACI recommendation (qualitative): ACI specifies **minimum reinforcement for temperature and shrinkage** — commonly in slabs-on-grade designers provide distributed reinforcement with minimum ratios on the order of 0.001 to 0.002 (for example, 0.0018 or similar values are often used) or minimum bar sizes/spacing (e.g., #3–#4 bars at prescribed maximum spacing). Exact values depend on slab type and code edition — always check current ACI provisions for the precise numeric minimums.
