:::danger[Difficulty: **Hard** - Category: **Concrete**]
A #10 bar ($d_b = 1.27~\text{in}$) in compression must be developed in normal-weight concrete with $f'_c = 5000~\text{psi}$ and $f_y = 60,000~\text{psi}$. The basic development length is $\ell_{dc} = 0.02d_b f_y/\lambda\sqrt{f'_c} = 21.5~\text{in}$ but not less than $0.0003d_b f_y = 22.9~\text{in}$. An available length of 20 inches is provided. Does the available length suffice to develop the bar in compression?

**Compression Development Length Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'suffice'**
'Suffice' means to **be adequate** or **be enough** for a purpose.

The question asks: Is 20 inches adequate?

**Step 2: Determine required development length**
Calculated: $\ell_{dc,calc} = 21.5~\text{in}$

Minimum: $\ell_{dc,min} = 22.9~\text{in}$

Required: $\ell_{dc} = \max(21.5, 22.9) = 22.9~\text{in}$

Also not less than: $8~\text{in}$ (absolute minimum)

**Step 3: Compare available to required**
Available length: $\ell_{avail} = 20~\text{in}$

Required length: $\ell_{dc} = 22.9~\text{in}$

$20~\text{in} < 22.9~\text{in}$

**Step 4: Determine adequacy**
Available length is **INSUFFICIENT** by:
$22.9 - 20 = 2.9~\text{in}$ (12.7% short)

Ratio: $\frac{\ell_{avail}}{\ell_{dc}} = \frac{20}{22.9} = 0.87 < 1.0$ ✗

**Step 5: Answer the question**
Does 20 in suffice (is it adequate) to develop the bar?

**NO** - The available length does NOT suffice to develop the bar in compression.

The provided length falls short of the minimum required development length.

**Common trap:** The word 'suffice' is straightforward but formal. The trap here is in the calculation - candidates must recognize that BOTH criteria apply (calculated AND minimum), and the larger value governs. Missing the 0.0003dbfy minimum check leads to wrong conclusion.

**Step 6: Check for modification factors**
Per ACI 318, compression development length may be multiplied by:
- Excess reinforcement factor: $\frac{A_{s,required}}{A_{s,provided}}$ (if applicable)
- Spiral/tie enclosure factor: 0.75 (if enclosed by spiral or ties)

Without information about these conditions, assume no reduction applies.

**Step 7: Required minimum length**
If ties provide confinement:
$\ell_{dc,reduced} = 0.75(22.9) = 17.2~\text{in}$

Then $20~\text{in} > 17.2~\text{in}$ ✓

But question doesn't specify confinement, so assume basic case.

**Step 8: Design recommendations**
- Extend bar additional 3 inches minimum
- Provide mechanical anchorage
- Use headed bars or anchor plates
- Verify tie/spiral confinement for reduction

**Answer: NO, the available length (20 in) does NOT suffice (is not adequate) to develop the #10 bar. Required length is 22.9 in minimum.**
