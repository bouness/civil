Describe two practical strategies designers use to limit crack widths in reinforced concrete slabs and beams to satisfy serviceability requirements.

Two practical strategies:

1. **Provide adequate reinforcement area and tighter spacing** — smaller-diameter bars more closely spaced (rather than fewer large bars) reduce crack spacing and crack width for a given strain.
2. **Control cover and bar placement** — reduce concrete cover and locate reinforcement close to the tensile face (within code minimums), and use distributed reinforcement (top and bottom as needed) to reduce crack widths.  
Additional strategies: use higher-strength or low-shrinkage concrete, add fibers, or use crack control reinforcement specifically for shrinkage/temperature loads.
