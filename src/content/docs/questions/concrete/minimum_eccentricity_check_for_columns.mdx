ACI 318 requires all compression members to be designed for a minimum moment to account for accidental eccentricity. What is the minimum eccentricity provision for tied columns according to ACI 318?

:::tip[Solution]
ACI 318-14 Section 10.3.5 requires that **compression members shall be designed for a minimum eccentricity** $e = 0.05h$, where $h$ is the dimension of the column in the direction of bending. This ensures no purely axial design is permitted.

Thus, even for concentric axial loads, a minimum bending moment corresponding to $M_u = P_u e$ must be applied.
