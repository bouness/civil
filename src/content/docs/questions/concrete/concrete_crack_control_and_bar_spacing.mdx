A concrete beam has #7 bars spaced at 8 inches on center in the tension zone with 2 inches of clear cover. Per ACI 318, crack control is deemed satisfactory when bar spacing does not exceed $s = 540/(f_s) - 2.5c_c$, where $f_s = 36~\text{ksi}$ and $c_c$ is clear cover. Does the provided spacing comport with crack control provisions?

**Crack Control Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'comport'**
'Comport' means to **agree with**, **comply with**, or **conform to** a requirement.

This is uncommon vocabulary that can cause confusion.

**Step 2: Calculate maximum permitted spacing**
$s_{max} = \frac{540}{f_s} - 2.5c_c$

Given:
- $f_s = 36~\text{ksi}$
- $c_c = 2~\text{in}$ (clear cover)

$s_{max} = \frac{540}{36} - 2.5(2) = 15 - 5 = 10~\text{in}$

**Step 3: Compare provided spacing to maximum**
Provided spacing: $s = 8~\text{in}$

Maximum permitted: $s_{max} = 10~\text{in}$

$8~\text{in} < 10~\text{in}$ ✓

**Step 4: Interpretation**
Does the spacing (8 in) comport with (comply with) the provisions?

**YES** - The provided spacing DOES comport with crack control provisions.

The actual spacing is less than the maximum allowed, therefore it complies with the requirement.

**Common trap:** The unusual word 'comport' might make candidates pause or misinterpret. Under stress, unfamiliar vocabulary can lead to errors even with correct calculations.

**Step 5: Alternative check (ACI 318-14 and later)**
Newer codes use skin reinforcement and different spacing criteria, but the principle remains: provided spacing must not exceed maximum permitted.

**Answer: YES, the spacing (8 in) comports with (complies with) crack control provisions because 8 in < 10 in maximum.**

**Vocabulary note:** Other NCEES synonyms for 'comply': comport, conform, satisfy, meet, fulfill, accord with.
