:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
A flat plate slab panel is 20 ft × 20 ft and 8 in thick. Determine if it qualifies as a **two-way slab** per ACI 318 aspect ratio limits.

<TabItem label='Solution'>
:::tip[Solution]
ACI 318 defines two-way action when the longer-to-shorter span ratio $\le 2$. Here,

$$
\frac{L_{long}}{L_{short}} = \frac{20}{20} = 1.0 < 2.0
$$

Hence, it is a **two-way slab**.
