A simply supported concrete beam is expected to sag under permanent dead load by 0.20 in at midspan. For appearance and serviceability, what initial upward camber would you specify so that the beam is approximately level under dead load?

:::tip[Solution]
To approximately eliminate visible sag, specify an initial upward camber equal to the expected dead-load sag.  
**Required camber** $=0.20~\text{in}$ (upward at midspan).

Note: Allow for construction tolerances and long-term creep; some designers specify slightly greater camber to account for long-term effects.
