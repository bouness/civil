:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
Concrete exposed to severe freeze-thaw conditions in a wet environment requires 6% air content per ACI 318. Testing shows the concrete has 4.5% air content. Does this air content vitiate the concrete's suitability for the exposure condition?

**Concrete Air Content Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'vitiate'**
'Vitiate' means to **spoil**, **impair**, or **make defective/invalid**.

This is sophisticated vocabulary rarely used in practice. It means to make something ineffective or unsuitable.

**Step 2: Compare values**
Required air content: 6%

Actual air content: 4.5%

$4.5\% < 6\%$

**Step 3: Analyze deficiency**
The concrete is deficient by: $6\% - 4.5\% = 1.5\%$

This is a **25% shortfall** from the required amount: $\frac{1.5}{6} = 0.25$

**Step 4: Freeze-thaw durability implications**
Air entrainment provides:
- Space for water expansion during freezing
- Protection against freeze-thaw damage
- Critical for durability in severe exposure

Insufficient air content leads to:
- Scaling and spalling
- Reduced service life
- Premature deterioration

**Step 5: Answer the question**
Does 4.5% air content vitiate (impair/make unsuitable) the concrete's suitability?

**YES** - The insufficient air content DOES vitiate the concrete's suitability.

The concrete does not meet the specified requirement for severe freeze-thaw exposure and is therefore unsuitable/defective for this application.

**Common trap:** 'Vitiate' sounds like it might mean 'validate' or 'verify,' but it means the opposite - to invalidate or impair.

**Step 6: Remedial action**
Options:
- Reject the concrete
- Add air-entraining admixture (if still plastic)
- Re-batch with proper air content
- Use in less severe exposure (if permitted)

**Answer: YES, the air content (4.5%) vitiates (impairs/invalidates) the concrete's suitability for severe freeze-thaw exposure (requires 6%).**
