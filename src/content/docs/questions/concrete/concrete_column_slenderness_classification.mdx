:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
A concrete column in a braced frame has $k = 0.85$, unbraced length $\ell_u = 14~\text{ft}$, and radius of gyration $r = 4.5~\text{in}$. Per ACI 318, a column is considered short when $k\ell_u/r \leq 34 - 12(M_1/M_2)$ for braced frames. Given $M_1/M_2 = 0.5$, does the column's slenderness ratio preclude classification as a short column?

**Column Slenderness Classification**

**Step 1: Understanding 'preclude classification as'**
'Preclude' means to **prevent** or **make impossible**.

The question asks: Does the ratio prevent the column from being classified as short?

This is a NEGATIVE question structure - asking if something prevents a classification.

**Step 2: Calculate slenderness ratio**
$\frac{k\ell_u}{r} = \frac{0.85(14 \times 12)}{4.5} = \frac{0.85(168)}{4.5} = \frac{142.8}{4.5} = 31.7$

**Step 3: Calculate limit for short columns**
$\lambda_{limit} = 34 - 12\left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right) = 34 - 12(0.5) = 34 - 6 = 28$

**Step 4: Compare values**
Actual slenderness: $\frac{k\ell_u}{r} = 31.7$

Limit for short column: $\lambda_{limit} = 28$

$31.7 > 28$

The column **EXCEEDS** the short column limit.

**Step 5: Determine classification**
Since $31.7 > 28$, the column does NOT qualify as a short column.

It must be classified as a **slender column** requiring moment magnification.

**Step 6: Answer the question carefully**
Does the slenderness ratio (31.7) preclude (prevent) classification as a short column?

**YES** - The slenderness ratio DOES preclude classification as a short column.

Because 31.7 > 28, the column cannot be classified as short. The excessive slenderness prevents (precludes) short column classification.

**Common trap:** The double-negative structure ('preclude classification as short') requires careful reading. Break it down:
- Can it be classified as short? NO (because 31.7 > 28)
- Does this prevent short classification? YES
- Therefore: YES, it precludes short classification

**Step 7: Design implications**
As a slender column:
- Must apply moment magnification: $\delta = \frac{C_m}{1 - P_u/0.75P_c} \geq 1.0$
- Design for $M_c = \delta M_2$
- Cannot use simplified design approach
- More conservative design required

**Step 8: Limit check**
By how much does it exceed?
$31.7 - 28 = 3.7$ (exceeds by 13%)

If column could be modified:
- Reduce $k$ (improve end restraint)
- Reduce $\ell_u$ (add intermediate support)
- Increase $r$ (larger cross-section)

**Answer: YES, the slenderness ratio (31.7) precludes (prevents) classification as a short column because 31.7 > 28. The column is SLENDER.**
