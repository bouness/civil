An unbraced concrete column has $k\ell_u/r = 28$. Per ACI 318, slenderness effects may be neglected when $k\ell_u/r \leq 22$ for unbraced columns. Does this column obviate moment magnification analysis?

**Slenderness Effects Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding the question**
'Obviate' means to **eliminate the need for** or **make unnecessary**.

The question asks: Does this column eliminate the need for moment magnification analysis?

**Step 2: Review criteria**
Per ACI 318, slenderness effects **may be neglected** when:
$k\ell_u/r \leq 22$ (for unbraced columns)

Given: $k\ell_u/r = 28$

**Step 3: Compare values**
$28 > 22$

The column **EXCEEDS** the slenderness limit.

**Step 4: Determine if analysis is required**
Since $28 > 22$, slenderness effects **CANNOT** be neglected.

Therefore, moment magnification analysis **IS REQUIRED**.

**Step 5: Answer the question**
Does this column obviate (eliminate the need for) moment magnification analysis?

**NO** - The column does NOT obviate moment magnification analysis.

Because the slenderness ratio exceeds the limit, the analysis **MUST** be performed. The column cannot eliminate the need for something that is required.

**Common trap:** Candidates might see the large slenderness value and think it 'obviates' (mistakenly thinking it means 'triggers' or 'requires') the analysis. The opposite is true - nothing can eliminate a required analysis when conditions demand it.

**Answer: NO, moment magnification analysis is REQUIRED and cannot be obviated.**
