:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Concrete**]
A construction joint in a concrete wall is subjected to a factored shear force $V_u = 60~\text{kips}$ across the joint. The joint surface is intentionally roughened to $\frac{1}{4}$~in amplitude. $f'_c = 4000~\text{psi}$, $f_y = 60000~\text{psi}$. Determine the required area of shear-friction reinforcement $A_{vf}$ per ACI 318.

**Shear Friction Reinforcement Design**

**Step 1: Determine friction coefficient $\mu$**
For intentionally roughened surface to $\frac{1}{4}$~in amplitude:
$\mu = 1.0$ (per ACI 318 Table 22.9.4.2)

**Step 2: Calculate required $A_{vf}$**
Shear-friction principle: $V_n = A_{vf} f_y \mu$

$\phi V_n \geq V_u$ where $\phi = 0.75$ for shear

$A_{vf} = \frac{V_u}{\phi f_y \mu} = \frac{60}{0.75 \times 60 \times 1.0} = \frac{60}{45} = 1.33~\text{in}^2$

**Step 3: Check maximum shear strength limit**
Maximum $V_n = 0.2f'_c A_c$ or $800A_c$ (whichever is smaller)
For typical wall section, this limit is rarely governing for construction joints.

**Step 4: Check minimum reinforcement**
Minimum $A_{vf} = \frac{0.75\sqrt{f'_c}}{f_y} b_w d$ but not less than $\frac{200b_w d}{f_y}$
This provides minimum shear reinforcement requirements.

**Required shear-friction reinforcement: $A_{vf} = 1.33~\text{in}^2$**

This reinforcement must be properly anchored on both sides of the joint to develop $f_y$ in tension.
