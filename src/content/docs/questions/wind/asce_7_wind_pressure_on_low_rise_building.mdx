Use the simplified equation to estimate the **basic wind pressure** at the windward face for a building exposed to a 3-second gust wind speed $V = 110~\text{mph}$ (ASCE 7-like). Use the basic velocity pressure formula $q = 0.00256 V^2$ (psf). Determine $q$.

**Compute velocity pressure:**

$$
q = 0.00256 V^2 = 0.00256(110^2)
$$

Calculate $110^2 = 12,100$. Then:

$$
q = 0.00256 \times 12,100 = 30.976~\text{psf}
$$

Thus, **$q = 30.98~\text{psf}$ (approximately)**.
