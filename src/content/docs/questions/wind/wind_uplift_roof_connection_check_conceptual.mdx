When designing roof edge and corner connections for wind uplift per ASCE 7, why are corner and edge regions treated differently from interior roof regions?

:::tip[Solution]
Corner and edge regions experience **higher local suction pressures** due to wind flow separation and three-dimensional effects — these regions often have uplift factors significantly larger than interior regions. ASCE 7 prescribes larger wind pressure coefficients (or different load multipliers) for corners and edges to account for these amplified effects and to ensure connections there are designed for higher uplift demand.
