A square isolated footing supports a $400~\text{k}$ column load. The footing is $6~\text{ft} \times 6~\text{ft}$ and rests on soil with an allowable bearing capacity of $4~\text{ksf}$. Determine the maximum soil bearing pressure and state whether the design is acceptable.

:::tip[Solution]
Footing area:

$$
A = 6 \times 6 = 36~\text{ft}^2
$$

Bearing pressure:

$$
q = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{400}{36} = 11.1~\text{ksf}
$$

Compare to allowable:

$$
11.1~\text{ksf} > 4~\text{ksf}
$$

Thus, **not acceptable**. The footing must be enlarged or load reduced.
