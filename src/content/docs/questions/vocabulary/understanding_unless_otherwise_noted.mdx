A drawing note says: **"All welds to be 3/16 in unless otherwise noted."** On one detail, no weld size is shown. Which weld size applies there?

A) 3/16 in  
B) Unknown — you must ask the inspector

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** The phrase **"unless otherwise noted"** sets the default value (3/16 in) that applies wherever no other specific note exists. The trap is thinking that because there is no note, the weld is unspecified — but the general note covers unspecified instances. Only if a specific detail **does** note a different size does that override the default.
