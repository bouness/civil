Correct answer: **B**.

**Why:** In code language, **"shall"** indicates a **mandatory requirement**, while **"should"** or words like **"recommended"** indicate advisory guidance (best practice) but are not strictly mandatory. Exam trick: watch for those modal verbs—"shall" = must; "should/may/recommended" = not mandatory.
