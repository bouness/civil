Compare these two notes and identify which one allows the more permissive design approach:

1) "Provide fireproofing minimum 1 in, unless otherwise required by code."  
2) "Provide fireproofing minimum 1 in, unless required by code."  
Which is more permissive and why?

Correct answer: **(1) is more permissive.**

**Why:** Note (1) sets a default minimum (1 in) but allows the code to override that **if the code requires something else** — i.e., it defers to the code when the code's requirements differ. Note (2) reads oddly: "unless required by code" could be interpreted to mean you only provide something if the code requires it (which would be less clear). The conventional clearer phrasing is (1): provide 1 in minimum, except when the code requires a different (usually larger) amount. The trap is subtle wording that flips the deference to code obligations.
