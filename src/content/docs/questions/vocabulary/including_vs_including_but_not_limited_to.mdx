:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **B**.

**Why:** The phrase **"including but not limited to"** explicitly indicates the listed items are examples and **others may apply**. Plain "including" can sometimes be interpreted as examples too, but legally and in exams the longer phrase is intentionally broader. If a question hinges on whether other methods are permitted, prefer the wording that explicitly says "not limited to."
