A spec says: **"Connections may be bolted, provided that the bolts develop the required shear capacity."** Which is the correct implication?

A) Bolting is permitted only if the bolts can develop required shear capacity.  
B) Bolting is permitted in all cases and you can ignore bolt capacity.

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** "Provided that" introduces a **condition**. The allowed action (bolting) is conditional on meeting the subsequent requirement (bolts must develop required shear capacity). The trap: skim readers may see "may be bolted" and stop there — always read the full conditional clause.
