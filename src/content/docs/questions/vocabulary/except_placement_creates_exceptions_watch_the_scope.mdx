Which is the correct reading of: **"All openings shall be sealed, except openings required for ventilation."**

A) Openings required for ventilation do not need sealing.  
B) All openings must be sealed, including ventilation openings.
:::
</TabItem>

<TabItem label='Solution'>
:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** The exception clause explicitly excludes ventilation openings from the sealing requirement. The trap is when students mentally drop the exception and apply the general rule universally. Always identify the noun phrase that the exception modifies (here, "openings").
