:::caution[Difficulty: **Medium** - Category: **Vocabulary**]
Which of these two sentences has a stricter meaning (fewer allowable cases)?

1) "A connection may be considered only if the bolts are A325."  
2) "Only if the bolts are A325 may the connection be considered."  
Are they the same, and what is the plain interpretation?

:::tip[Solution]
Both sentences have the **same meaning**: the connection is **allowed (may be considered)** **only when** the bolts are A325.  

**Why:** Both place the restriction on the condition — the condition (bolts are A325) is required for the permissive action (considering the connection). The trap is that moving "only" around can look subtle but here it attaches to the conditional and yields the same logical constraint. However, be careful: if written "The connection may only be considered with bolts A325 or A490," it could be misread — always attach "only" to the word/phrase it limits.
