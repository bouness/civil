A clause reads: **"Field splices are not allowed, unless specifically allowed in the contract documents."** During an exam question you find a detail in the contract documents allowing one specific field splice at location X. For another location Y that is not mentioned, may a splice be made there?

A) Yes — it is permitted because contract documents are flexible.  
B) No — only the specifically allowed splice(s) in the contract documents are permitted; all others are prohibited.

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **B**.

**Why:** The clause prohibits field splices **except** for those that the contract documents explicitly permit. If the contract documents only allow location X, then Y is not permitted. The trap is assuming the exception is generic; the phrase **"unless specifically allowed"** limits permission to the explicit cases only.
