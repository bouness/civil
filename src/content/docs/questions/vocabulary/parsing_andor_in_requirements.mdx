:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **D**.

**Why:** The term **"and/or"** is inclusive: it permits **A**, **B**, or **A and B**. The true governing criterion is the performance requirement (resist distortion). So the clause allows any of the three solutions as long as the required function is met. Exam trap: students often think "and/or" means "either-or"; it's actually inclusive.
