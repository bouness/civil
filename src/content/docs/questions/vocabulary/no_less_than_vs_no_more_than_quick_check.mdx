A) 0.2%

C) There is no minimum

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** "No less than 0.2%" means the provided reinforcement must be **at least 0.2%** of section area. Convert percentages carefully — some candidates confuse 0.2% with 0.02 but the notation here is explicit. The exam trap is misplacing the decimal.
