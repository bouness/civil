A requirement states: **"The contractor shall not use vibration monitoring devices, unless the engineer requests monitoring."** Which is the operative instruction?

C) Contractor may use monitoring at their discretion.

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **B**.

**Why:** The phrase "shall not ... unless ..." prohibits the action except under the stated condition. So the contractor **cannot** use devices unless the engineer requests them. The trap is misreading the clause as permissive; the default is prohibition with a stated exception.
