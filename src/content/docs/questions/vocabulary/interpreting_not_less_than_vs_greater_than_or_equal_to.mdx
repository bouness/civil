An instruction reads: **"Provide reinforcement spacing not less than 12 in."** Which mathematical inequality best matches that wording?

A) spacing ≥ 12 in  
B) spacing ≤ 12 in

:::tip[Solution]
Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** The phrase **"not less than 12 in"** literally means the spacing is **12 inches or more** (i.e., greater than or equal to 12 in). Candidates sometimes misread the negative construction and think it means the opposite. When you see "not less than X," read it as "X or more."
