A specification states: **"Use of epoxy-coated reinforcement shall be permitted, except where special detailing requirements preclude its use."** Which is the correct interpretation?

A) Epoxy-coated reinforcement is allowed everywhere unless special detailing specifically prevents it.  
B) Epoxy-coated reinforcement is prohibited everywhere except where special detailing explicitly allows it.

Correct answer: **A**.

**Why:** The key word is **"preclude"**, which means **to prevent or make impossible**. The clause says epoxy-coated reinforcement is permitted (allowed), **except where** special detailing would prevent its use. So the default is permissive and only those detailing situations that *prevent* (preclude) its use disallow it. Many people flip the meaning because "preclude" is uncommon in everyday speech; read it as "prevent" and the sentence becomes clear.
