Correct answer: **B**.

**Why:** "Not uncommon" is a double-negative idiom meaning **it does occur somewhat frequently**. Exam writers sometimes use these to bait test-takers into thinking the phrase means rare. When you see double negatives like "not unlikely," "not uncommon," translate them mentally to their positive sense ("somewhat likely", "fairly common").
