Explain briefly what the coefficient of subgrade reaction $k$ (used in Winkler foundation models) represents and one limitation of using a single $k$ value for a large foundation.

**Short answer:**
The coefficient of subgrade reaction $k$ represents the linear relationship between soil pressure and local settlement in a Winkler (spring) foundation model, i.e., $p = k w$, where $p$ is pressure and $w$ is deflection. It is a simplified idealization of soil stiffness per unit area.
**Limitation:** A single $k$ assumes homogeneous, local spring-like behavior and cannot capture soil continuity, load transfer between springs, scale effects, or variation of stiffness with depth and loading area — leading to inaccurate settlement predictions for large foundations or layered soils.
