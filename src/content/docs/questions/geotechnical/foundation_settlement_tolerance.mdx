Two adjacent footings supporting columns are predicted to settle 1.8 inches and 2.6 inches respectively, resulting in a differential settlement of 0.8 inches over a span of 25 ft. The maximum tolerable differential settlement for the structure is $\Delta/L = 1/300$. Does the predicted differential settlement transgress the tolerable limit?

**Differential Settlement Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'transgress'**
'Transgress' means to **violate**, **exceed**, or **go beyond** a limit or boundary.

This is formal/literary vocabulary meaning to break a rule or cross a line.

**Step 2: Calculate tolerable differential settlement**
$\Delta_{allow} = \frac{L}{300} = \frac{25 \times 12}{300} = \frac{300}{300} = 1.0~\text{in}$

**Step 3: Compare predicted to tolerable**
Predicted differential: $\Delta = 0.8~\text{in}$

Tolerable limit: $\Delta_{allow} = 1.0~\text{in}$

$0.8~\text{in} < 1.0~\text{in}$

**Step 4: Interpretation**
Does 0.8 in transgress (violate/exceed) the 1.0 in limit?

**NO** - The predicted settlement does NOT transgress the tolerable limit.

The differential settlement is within acceptable limits and does not violate the criterion.

**Common trap:** 'Transgress' is uncommon vocabulary that sounds severe, potentially causing candidates to second-guess their calculations. The numbers being close (0.8 vs 1.0) adds to potential confusion.

**Step 5: Safety margin**
Margin: $1.0 - 0.8 = 0.2~\text{in}$

Percentage utilized: $\frac{0.8}{1.0} = 80\%$ of allowable

20% margin remains.

**Step 6: Angular distortion check**
$\text{Angular distortion} = \frac{\Delta}{L} = \frac{0.8}{25 \times 12} = \frac{0.8}{300} = \frac{1}{375}$

$\frac{1}{375} < \frac{1}{300}$ ✓ (smaller fraction = less distortion)

**Step 7: Structural implications**
Angular distortion of 1/375:
- Acceptable for most building frames
- Well within safe limits
- Unlikely to cause cracking or damage

For reference:
- 1/150: Visible damage to structure
- 1/250: Difficulty with machinery
- 1/300: Safe limit for flexible buildings
- 1/500: Safe for rigid structures

**Answer: NO, the differential settlement (0.8 in, or 1/375) does NOT transgress (violate) the tolerable limit (1.0 in, or 1/300). Settlement is acceptable.**
