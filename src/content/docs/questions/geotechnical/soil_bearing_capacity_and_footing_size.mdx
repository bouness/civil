A square footing must support a column load of 280 kips (service load). The allowable soil bearing pressure is 4000 psf. A 9 ft × 9 ft footing is proposed. Does the footing size suffice for the given load and soil conditions?

**Footing Bearing Pressure Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'suffice'**
'Suffice' means to be **enough** or **adequate** for a purpose.

The question asks: Is the footing size adequate?

**Step 2: Calculate required footing area**
$A_{req} = \frac{P}{q_{allow}} = \frac{280,000~\text{lbs}}{4000~\text{psf}} = 70~\text{sq ft}$

**Step 3: Calculate provided footing area**
$A_{prov} = 9 \times 9 = 81~\text{sq ft}$

**Step 4: Compare areas**
$81~\text{sq ft} > 70~\text{sq ft}$

Provided area **EXCEEDS** required area.

**Step 5: Calculate actual bearing pressure**
$q_{actual} = \frac{P}{A_{prov}} = \frac{280,000}{81} = 3457~\text{psf}$

$3457~\text{psf} < 4000~\text{psf}$ ✓

**Step 6: Answer the question**
Does the 9 ft × 9 ft footing suffice (is it adequate)?

**YES** - The footing size DOES suffice for the given conditions.

The footing provides 81 sq ft when only 70 sq ft is required, and the actual bearing pressure (3457 psf) is less than allowable (4000 psf).

**Common trap:** The straightforward word 'suffice' is less tricky, but NCEES tests whether candidates actually perform the calculation rather than assuming the given size is inadequate because the question is asked.

**Step 7: Design margin**
Area margin: $\frac{81 - 70}{70} = 15.7\%$ excess capacity

Pressure margin: $\frac{4000 - 3457}{4000} = 13.6\%$ unused capacity

**Answer: YES, the 9 ft × 9 ft footing suffices (is adequate) because 81 sq ft > 70 sq ft required and 3457 psf < 4000 psf allowable.**
