A retaining wall design uses active earth pressure with $K_a = 0.33$. The backfill has a saturated unit weight of $\gamma_{sat} = 125~\text{pcf}$ and moist unit weight of $\gamma_{moist} = 115~\text{pcf}$. A functional drainage system is installed behind the wall. Does the presence of drainage preclude using the moist unit weight in earth pressure calculations?

**Earth Pressure and Drainage Analysis**

**Step 1: Understanding 'preclude'**
'Preclude' means to **prevent** or **make impossible**.

The question asks: Does drainage **prevent** the use of moist unit weight?

**Step 2: Role of drainage systems**
A functional drainage system:
- Removes water from behind the wall
- Prevents buildup of hydrostatic pressure
- Keeps backfill in a drained (unsaturated) condition

**Step 3: Appropriate unit weight selection**
With effective drainage:
- Use **moist (drained) unit weight**: $\gamma_{moist} = 115~\text{pcf}$ ✓
- Do NOT use saturated unit weight: $\gamma_{sat} = 125~\text{pcf}$

Without drainage or with saturated conditions:
- Use saturated unit weight: $\gamma_{sat} = 125~\text{pcf}$
- May need to add hydrostatic pressure separately

**Step 4: Answer the question**
Does drainage **preclude** (prevent) using moist unit weight?

**NO** - Drainage does NOT preclude using moist unit weight.

In fact, drainage **allows** or **requires** using the moist unit weight. The presence of drainage makes it **appropriate** to use $\gamma_{moist}$.

**Common trap:** The tricky language suggests drainage might prevent using moist weight, when actually drainage is the reason we **CAN** use moist weight.

**Step 5: Calculation impact**
$P_a = \frac{1}{2}\gamma H^2 K_a$

With drainage: Use $\gamma = 115~\text{pcf}$ (lower pressure) ✓
Without drainage: Use $\gamma = 125~\text{pcf}$ + hydrostatic (higher pressure)

**Answer: NO, drainage does NOT preclude (prevent) using moist unit weight. Drainage actually ALLOWS its use.**
