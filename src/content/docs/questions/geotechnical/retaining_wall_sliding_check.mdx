A vertical cantilever retaining wall resists an active lateral earth thrust of $P_a = 18~\text{kips/ft}$ (per unit length). The base friction coefficient between concrete and soil is $\mu = 0.4$. The vertical overburden (including self-weight and surcharge) produces a normal force $N = 50~\text{kips/ft}$ at the base. Determine the factor of safety against sliding: $FS = \frac{\mu N}{P_a}$.

:::tip[Solution]
**Compute resisting frictional force:**

$$
R = \mu N = 0.4(50) = 20~\text{kips/ft}
$$

**Factor of safety:**

$$
FS = \frac{R}{P_a} = \frac{20}{18} = 1.111...
$$

Round reasonably: **$FS \approx 1.11$ (acceptable usually if >1.5; here it is low).**
