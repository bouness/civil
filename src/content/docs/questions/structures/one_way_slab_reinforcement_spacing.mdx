**Answer: C**

ACI 318-19 Section 7.7.2.3 specifies the maximum spacing of flexural reinforcement in one-way solid slabs.

The spacing shall not exceed:
1. **3 times the slab thickness, $3h$**, OR
2. **18 inches**.

Since the problem does not provide the slab thickness $h$, we must use the second, absolute limit. Therefore, the maximum spacing is **18 inches**.

Even if the slab were very thick (e.g., 10 inches, making $3h = 30$ inches), the 18-inch limit would still govern. For #6 bars, there is no additional restriction as they are smaller than #11 bars mentioned in other clauses.
