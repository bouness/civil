A built-up column consists of two C12x25 channels, 10 ft long, placed back-to-back with a 1/2" gap. The channels are latticed together. The column is pinned at both ends. Material is A36 steel.

Given: $A_g = 14.7~\text{in}^2$ total, $I_x = 443~\text{in}^4$, $I_y = 10.1~\text{in}^4$ per channel. The centroid is 0.674 in from the back of the web.

Determine the governing slenderness ratio for axial compression.

**Governing Slenderness Ratio**

**Step 1: Moment of Inertia about each axis**
- **X-X Axis (Strong Axis):** The channels are separated, so we use the parallel axis theorem.
  
$$
I_x^{total} = 2 \times I_x = 2 \times 443 = 886~\text{in}^4
$$


- **Y-Y Axis (Weak Axis):** The channels are 1/2" apart, plus the distance from the centroid to the back of the web.
  Distance between centroids, $a = 0.5 + 2\times0.674 = 1.848~\text{in}$
  
$$
I_y^{total} = 2 \times [I_y + A_g \times (a/2)^2] = 2 \times [10.1 + 7.35 \times (0.924)^2]
$$

  
$$
I_y^{total} = 2 \times [10.1 + 7.35 \times 0.854] = 2 \times [10.1 + 6.28] = 2 \times 16.38 = 32.76~\text{in}^4
$$


**Step 2: Radius of Gyration**

$$
r_x = \sqrt{\frac{I_x^{total}}{A_{total}}} = \sqrt{\frac{886}{14.7}} = 7.76~\text{in}
$$


$$
r_y = \sqrt{\frac{I_y^{total}}{A_{total}}} = \sqrt{\frac{32.76}{14.7}} = 1.49~\text{in}
$$


**Step 3: Slenderness Ratios**

$$
\frac{KL}{r_x} = \frac{1.0 \times (10\times12)}{7.76} = \frac{120}{7.76} = 15.5
$$


$$
\frac{KL}{r_y} = \frac{1.0 \times (10\times12)}{1.49} = \frac{120}{1.49} = 80.5
$$


**The governing slenderness ratio is 80.5 (weak axis).**
