A rectangular building is 120 ft × 80 ft in plan and 40 ft tall. The building is located in flat terrain with basic wind speed $V = 115~\text{mph}$ (Risk Category II). The building is classified as enclosed with Exposure Category C.

Using ASCE 7 simplified procedure, determine the design wind pressure on the windward wall at roof level.

**Step 1: Check if simplified procedure applies**

Requirements:
- Building height ≤ 60 ft ✓ (40 ft)
- Regular shape ✓
- No unusual response ✓

Simplified procedure is applicable.

**Step 2: Determine velocity pressure exposure coefficient**

At height $z = 40~\text{ft}$ for Exposure C (ASCE 7 Table):

$$
K_z = 0.98
$$


**Step 3: Calculate velocity pressure**

$$
q_z = 0.00256 K_z K_{zt} K_d V^2
$$


Where:
- $K_{zt} = 1.0$ (flat terrain, no topographic effects)
- $K_d = 0.85$ (standard buildings)

$$
q_z = 0.00256 \times 0.98 \times 1.0 \times 0.85 \times 115^2 = 29.4~\text{psf}
$$


**Step 4: Determine external pressure coefficient**

For windward wall: $C_p = 0.8$ (ASCE 7)

**Step 5: Calculate design wind pressure**

$$
p = q \times G \times C_p
$$


Where $G = 0.85$ (gust effect factor):

$$
p = 29.4 \times 0.85 \times 0.8 = 20.0~\text{psf}
$$


**Answer:** Design wind pressure on windward wall at roof level = **20.0 psf**
