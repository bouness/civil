A **30-ft tall** rectangular building in **Exposure B** has a fundamental natural frequency greater than 1 Hz. The design wind speed is $115~\text{mph}$.
What is:
The design wind pressure (psf) at the roof height for the main wind force resisting system? Use the simplified procedure from ASCE 7.

**Design Wind Pressure**
Using ASCE 7-16 simplified procedure for a building < 60 ft in Exposure B.
From the simplified design wind pressure tables, for a wind speed of $115~\text{mph}$ and Exposure B, the horizontal wind pressure at roof height for the MWFRS is approximately $20.0~\text{psf}$.
Thus, the design wind pressure at roof height is about $\mathbf{20~\text{psf}}$.
