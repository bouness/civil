A wood structural panel floor system has a calculated deflection under live load of $\Delta_L = 0.42~\text{in}$ over a span of $L = 16~\text{ft}$. The deflection limit is $L/240$. Does the calculated deflection comport with deflection criteria?

**Wood Panel Deflection Check**

**Step 1: Understanding 'comport with'**
'Comport with' means to **agree with**, **comply with**, or **conform to**.

The question asks: Does the deflection comply with the criteria?

**Step 2: Calculate allowable deflection**
$\Delta_{allow} = \frac{L}{240} = \frac{16 \times 12}{240} = \frac{192}{240} = 0.80~\text{in}$

**Step 3: Compare actual to allowable**
Actual deflection: $\Delta_L = 0.42~\text{in}$

Allowable deflection: $\Delta_{allow} = 0.80~\text{in}$

$0.42~\text{in} < 0.80~\text{in}$

**Step 4: Determine compliance**
The actual deflection is **LESS THAN** the allowable limit.

Deflection is **ACCEPTABLE**.

**Step 5: Answer the question**
Does 0.42 in comport with (comply with) the 0.80 in limit?

**YES** - The calculated deflection DOES comport with deflection criteria.

The deflection is within acceptable limits and complies with the requirement.

**Step 6: Safety margin**
Margin: $0.80 - 0.42 = 0.38~\text{in}$

Percentage used: $\frac{0.42}{0.80} = 52.5\%$ of allowable

Significant margin remains (47.5% unused capacity).

**Step 7: Practical considerations**
For wood floors:
- $L/240$ is common for residential
- $L/360$ may be required for tile finishes or sensitive occupancies
- Calculated deflection is comfortable within limit
- Unlikely to cause cracking or occupant complaints

**Answer: YES, the deflection (0.42 in) comports with (complies with) the criteria (0.80 in limit). The floor system is acceptable.**
